                Happy Birthday Milky. Thank you for your fantastic streams, 
                especially your excellent karaoke streams, and for the squad 
                games nights. I always look forward to a stream 
                (even the Cats watchalong) and I have had so much with you and 
                the squad. Thank you for your interesting ideas, whether they 
                be riddles, tours, or even chicken karaoke. And a thank you for
                wishing me a happy birthday when it was mine. Congratulations 
                on 10K followers, raising £10K for GOSH, and congratulations 
                on getting partner. And another congratulations on your birthday.
                Here&#039;s to another year of the Miru Miru Squad! I hope you achieve 
                your wildest dreams.

                I am so glad that I discovered you when I did, you have been such 
                a joy in my life these past few months. Even as a newer fan I can 
                see how hard you have worked these past 3+ years and it is awe 
                inspiring. Your covers are amazing, your work with Mai Princess is 
                wonderful and your original music is some of my favorite music of 
                all time. Your singing is so beautiful and I cannot wait for more 
                original music that you have planned down the road. The future is 
                very bright for you Milky and I can’t wait to follow along and see 
                what you accomplish!

              Happy Birthday, Milky~
              It hasn&#039;t been long since we&#039;ve crossed paths, but your 
              influence has really changed my life. Because of you, I have met
              my favourite artists (You are one of them of course, haha) and I
              have finally taken the first step of creating. I always enjoy 
              your singing and admire your creativity. Your hard-working and 
              supportive personality is also very motiving as well. I wish you 
              the best for your career and keep Flicking the Future ;D
